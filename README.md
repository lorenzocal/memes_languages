# Studying Linguistic References Across Cultures Using Memes

Internet memes are presented as a breakthrough digital tool
using references to uniquely express oneâ€™s ideas and feelings all over the
internet and through different communities. Distinct from prior studies
that have been focusing on meme virality or classification, our research
aims to demonstrate the linguistic and cultural foundations of memes.
Analyzing how memes, messages, and semantic frames appear in English,
French, and Chinese contexts, capturing cross-cultural with the help of
Large Language Models (LLMs), frame semantic transformers, and OCR
tools. Our frame extraction pipeline outputs interpretations from meme
contents in any chosen language. Then a semantic similarity-based clustering
is applied to group related memes to deepenour understanding of
the relationship between the meme instance.
